          <h2>Professional Biography</h2>
          <p>
            With a background in software modification since the age of 10, I've
            cultivated a deep understanding of technology and its applications.
            My journey in tech began early, securing my first IT job at just 11
            years old. This early start has provided me with a unique
            perspective and a wealth of experience in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a seasoned frontend engineer, I've developed a keen eye for user
            experience and interface design. My passion for problem-solving
            through technology drives me to continuously expand my skillset and
            tackle new challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

        <section id="altschool-reason">
          <h2>Why I Chose AltSchool</h2>
          <p>

          <p>
            While external motivation plays a minor role, my primary drive comes
            from an intrinsic desire for self-improvement and the pursuit of
            excellence in my craft.
